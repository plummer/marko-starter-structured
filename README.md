# Marker Starter Structured

A starter project for isomorphic marko that contrasts with the standard Express.js example with:

- An example folder structure with nested components
- Separated routes and controllers
- SCSS included
- production config for lasso separated out
- npm scripts for browser-refresh `npm run dev` and production `npm run production`
- @lasso/marko-taglib included

FYI This project is really just storage for personal use.
